Portfolio

This website showcases my work as a designer and is developed and designed by me. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to code the site. All assets used are made by me for the website itself or some other project I was working on. I plan on adding more of my projects to it later and making a few more changes along the way.  I hope you enjoy my portfolio.
